# Portfolio
## 🐈 Description
Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project showcases my skills and projects in web development. It's built using HTML and CSS, featuring a clean and responsive design.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

I decided to use vanilla HTML and CSS in this project to freshen up my basics, and challenged myself to see if I would still need to google code 😂 (of course I need to google things)
